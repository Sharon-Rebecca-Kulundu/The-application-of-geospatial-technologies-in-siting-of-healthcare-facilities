Planning the location of healthcare facilities is a very important aspect of ensuring equitable access to healthcare facilities.

Despite the importance of good health and well-being, the country and to be more specific Kajiado County is far from having equitable access to health facilities. The location of these health facilities does not correspond to the needs of the population in Kajiado County.
The existing methods of identifying new locations lack criteria that account for the spatial spread of population making new locations to be identified based on political goodwill.

The overall objective was to use Geospatial technology to determine suitable sites for setting up health facilities in the County. Specifically, it sought to identify criteria that influence the location of a health facility, generation of digital maps showing the existing locations of the healthcare facilities, major roads, rivers, railway lines and towns in Kajiado County. 
Finally, using the criteria identified to perform multi-criteria analysis to identify the most optimal locations for new healthcare facilities.

The project utilized available literature for setting location criteria to develop a set of criteria for the location of new healthcare facilities. Also, digital maps depicting the various criteria were generated. The multi-criteria analysis was performed to come up with the most optimal areas to locate new healthcare facilities. Flood analysis was also carried out using a DEM of Kajiado to establish the areas that are susceptible to floods to make sure the sites for the new health care facilities were free from dangers of flooding. 

The results showed that the most optimal areas are within the following wards; Kuku, Mosiro, Matapato North, Matapato South, Ewaso Oonkidongâ€™i, Kaputiei North, Rurko, Ildamat, Dalalekutuk, Entonet/ Lenkisim, Mbirikani/ Eselenkei, Oloosirken sholinke and Keekonyonke which are in the northeastern, central and some parts of Southern Kajiado. 
It can be concluded that Geospatial technologies, GIS to be specific can be applied in a decision support system for the selection of suitable sites for location of health care facilities in the country and globally which can help curb unplanned growth of the facilities and prevent wastage of resources.
